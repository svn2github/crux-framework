Why it is called _*Crux*_?



==_*Crux*_ Design==
Why _*Crux*_ uses {{{<span>}}} and not other tags like {{{div}}} or even custom tags (like {{{<grid>}}} or something similar) in host pages to declare widgets? And why does it put an `_` before all attributes and events names?


==Performance==
How fast _*Crux*_ declarative approach can be compared with default GWT approach (programatic)?

How much can _*Crux*_ increase the final javascript size? And the host page size?

Using _*Crux*_, usually I write strings that contains the name of my controller and the method name that I want to call (in pages). GWT does not support reflection for performance reasons. Does _*Crux*_ approach break this GWT design to emulate reflection? If not, how _*Crux*_ make these types of calls without use reflection?

About server side code? _*Crux*_ add any overhead?
