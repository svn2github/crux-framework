Why it is called _*Crux*_?



==_*Crux*_ Design==
Why _*Crux*_ uses {{{<span>}}} and not other tags like {{{div}}} or even custom tags (like {{{<grid>}}} or something similar) in host pages to declare widgets? And why does it put an `_` before all attributes and events names?

*Q: How _Crux_ checks if the application is under a development environment?*

R: To find out if your application is running under a development environment, _*Crux*_ checks for this two conditions. If one of them is true, it assumes a development environment:
  # Your application server was started by GWT HostedMode class.
  # Your application server is running in debug mode.



==Performance==
How fast _*Crux*_ declarative approach can be compared with default GWT approach (programmatic)?

How much can _*Crux*_ increase the final javascript size? And the host page size?

Using _*Crux*_, usually I write strings that contains the name of my controller and the method name that I want to call (in pages). GWT does not support reflection for performance reasons. Does _*Crux*_ approach break this GWT design to emulate reflection? If not, how _*Crux*_ make these types of calls without use reflection?

About server side code? _*Crux*_ add any overhead?





The CruxFilter will be used to save the name of the page that is beeing requested. _*Crux*_ parses all pages to know the pages that use each module. That information is needed to help increase the performance and decrease the size of generated scritp.
