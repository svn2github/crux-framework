*Q: Why is it called _Crux_?*

A: _*Crux*_ is the hardest point in a climbing. One of the authors (Thiago) is a climber (at least he tries :) )... 

==_*Crux*_ Design==
*Q: Why create widgets declaratively inside the HTML page?*

A: The goal of the _*Crux*_ design is avoid that you need to write any other visual artifact in adition of your page.
We consider that XML files with component information (like you have in JSF and other frameworks) turn the development process harder than it need to be. 

Even the GWT model (that is similar to java swing) is harder to code than _*Crux*_ model that keep all the visual part of the interface in the same file and can be understood (and writen) much easier than lot of java code.  

Of course, the GWT programmatic mechanism to create widgets is more powerfull. It allows that widgets be created at runtime, depending on some user action. _*Crux*_ supports that you work mixing the two strategies. We are glad that GWT works how it is. It allows _Crux_ to create the widgets programmatically, based on a parser on the current page document.
