== History ==

_*Crux*_ is a component framework created over [http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/ GWT] for fast development of web applications.

It is derived from a masters degree dissertation that was defended in 2008 at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) - Minas Gerais, Brazil -  and can be read [http://www.dcc.ufmg.br/pos/cursos/defesas/980M.PDF here] (available only in portuguese).

_*Crux*_ is now mantained by [http://www.sysmap.com.br Sysmap Solutions Software e Consultoria LTDA.] as an open source project.

==Example==

_*Crux*_ provides a declarative way for component creation. It uses _<span>_ tags to inform that a component must be created at the specific location on the page. Look at the following code:

{{{
<html>
   <head>
       <script language='javascript' src='br.com.sysmap.teste.CruxTeste.nocache.js'></script>
   </head>
   <body>
       <span id='myButton' _type='button' _value='Hello' _onclick='clientHandler.helloWorld' />
   </body>
</html>
}}}
