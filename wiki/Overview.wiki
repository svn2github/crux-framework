#summary Crux overview.

== History ==

_*Crux*_ is a component framework created over [http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/ GWT] for fast development of web applications.

It is derived from a masters degree dissertation that was defended in 2008 at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) - Minas Gerais, Brazil -  and can be read [http://www.dcc.ufmg.br/pos/cursos/defesas/980M.PDF here] (available only in portuguese).

_*Crux*_ is now mantained by [http://www.sysmap.com.br Sysmap Solutions] as an open source project.

==Example==

The following example assumes that you are familiar with [http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/ GWT]. If this is not the case, please consult its documentation first for better understand this example.

_*Crux*_ provides a declarative way for component creation. It uses _<span>_ tags to inform that a component must be created at the specific location on the page. Look at the following code:

{{{
<html>
   <head>
       <script language='javascript' src='br.com.sysmap.test.CruxTest.nocache.js'></script>
   </head>
   <body>
       <span id='myButton' _type='button' _value='Hello' _onclick='clientHandler.helloWorld' />
   </body>
</html>
}}}

This code is a GWT host page for a hypothetical example module called _CruxTest_ .

You can see that a _<span>_ tag is used to inform that a component of type _'button'_ must be rendered at the body of html page. That button contains a click event pointing to _'clientHandler.helloWorld'_. It means that a method called _'helloWorld'_ from a class identified by the alias _'clientHandler'_ will be called to handle this event calls.

You can see at the following code block how we tell _*Crux*_ which  class must be associated with the alias _'clientHandler'_:

{{{
package br.com.sysmap.test.client;
import com.google.gwt.user.client.Window;

@ClientController("clientHandler")
public class Teste
{
   public void helloWorld()
   {
      Window.alert("Hello World!!");
   }
}
}}}

And now you can see the code for the _CruxTest_ module declaration:
{{{
<module>
   <inherits name='br.com.sysmap.crux.core.Crux'/>
</module>
}}}
