= _*Crux*_ Artifacts and Projects=

_*Crux*_ distribution includes a set of jar files:
  # crux-runtime.jar - The runtime jar of _*Crux*_ framework.
  # crux-dev.jar - The _*Crux*_ tools for development with _*Crux*_.
  # crux-themes.jar - The standard css to all _*Crux*_ widgets.
  # crux-gadgets.jar - Support for Gadgets creation with _*Crux*_
  # crux-widgets.jar - The _*Crux*_ widget library.
  
These files can be generated using ant. All you need is download the _*Crux*_ project from its repository [http://code.google.com/p/crux-framework/source/checkout repository]:
  # /Crux
  
In addition of _*Crux*_ project, we have two projects that you need to download to build the _*Crux*_ distribution:
  # /CruxRelease - This project contains the ant build file needed to create the distribution file.
  # /CruxQuickstart - This project contains the quickstart application.
  # /HelloWorld - This project contains a sample helloWorld application included in distribution file.
 
= Building _*Crux*_ Projects=
  
To build _*Crux*_ you need:
  # A JDK 1.6+ (Tested with sun JDK 1.6 and openJDK 1.6) 
  # Eclipse IDE (Tested with 3.6 on Linux and Windows)

After meet the previous requirements, you must:

  # Checkout the projects from _*Crux*_ [http://code.google.com/p/crux-framework/source/checkout repository];
  # Run the ant build file /Crux/build/build.xml, calling the task {{{<dist>}}};

To generate the final distribution file, just run the ant build file /CruxRelease/build/build.xml, calling the task {{{<dist>}}};
